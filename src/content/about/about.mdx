Hello, I'm Brandon. I live in Orange County, CA and Iâ€™m a Full Stack Developer that is interested in building full scale applications that help solve problems in real life.

In my free time, I like to play tennis, video games, and table top games. I love connecting with people and listening to all types of stories.
